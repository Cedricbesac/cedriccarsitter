## 📋 About the Project

This repository hosts the code and documentation for **Cedric CarSitter**, a fleet management solution for private owners and investors based in Barcelona, Catalonia.

**Our Mission:** Empower vehicle owners to generate passive income via car-sharing platforms (Getaround, Amovens) without handling the operational complexity.

This project is not just a showcase; it is the digital interface of 20 years of field expertise (Ex-Leaseway, Automotive Expert).

## 🎯 Scope & Philosophy

### Core Business (What we do)
* **Yield Management:** Pricing and schedule optimization to maximize occupancy rates.
* **Asset Management:** Preserving vehicle value through preventive maintenance and rigorous mechanical monitoring.
* **Single Interface:** End-to-end management (Listing creation, tenant relations, claims handling).

### 🚫 What we are NOT
To clarify the technical and commercial positioning:
* ❌ We are **NOT** a cleaning company (cleaning is a process, not the product).
* ❌ We are **NOT** a convoy/transport service (moving cars is logistics, not the goal).
* ❌ We are **NOT** a guarded parking lot.
